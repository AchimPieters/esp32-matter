# CLAUDE.md — project context for Claude Code

This file is read automatically at the start of a Claude Code session. It captures
the intent and conventions for this repository so any session can pick up where we
left off.

## What this project is

`esp32-matter` — a fully transparent toolkit for building **Matter** smart-home
devices on ESP32 chips. Tagline: "ESP-ZeroCode Modules for Out-of-the-Box Matter
Connectivity" (AchimPieters / StudioPieters).

Core principles (do not violate these):
- **No hidden code.** Everything is plain, readable C++/shell/YAML built on the
  open-source [esp-matter](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter) SDK. No
  prebuilt/obfuscated framework blobs.
- **No cloud, no data sharing, no telemetry.** Matter is local-first: pairing
  over BLE + LAN, control over the local network. Never add code that phones home.
- **Local QR generation.** Commissioning data + QR are generated offline.
- License: **MIT**.

## Development environment (Docker-first)

We use the Docker-based ESP-IDF workflow from
<https://www.studiopieters.nl/esp32-homekit-development/>, adapted for Matter.
The HomeKit guide uses the `espressif/idf` image, which does NOT contain
esp-matter — so we use the **`espressif/esp-matter`** image instead (ESP-IDF +
esp-matter pre-installed, `IDF_PATH` and `ESP_MATTER_PATH` already set).

Open the environment:
```bash
./tools/dev.sh          # wraps: docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/project -w /project espressif/esp-matter:latest /bin/bash
```

Default build target: classic **ESP32 (WROOM-32)**. Also supports esp32c3 / c6 /
s3 / h2. (C6/H2 additionally support Thread; classic ESP32 is Wi-Fi.)

## Common commands

Build (inside the container):
```bash
. "$IDF_PATH/export.sh" && . "$ESP_MATTER_PATH/export.sh"
cd firmware/light
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
```

Flash (from the HOST, not the container — Docker Desktop on macOS can't see USB):
```bash
esptool.py -p <PORT> write_flash \
  0x0     firmware/light/build/bootloader/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware/light/build/partition_table/partition-table.bin \
  0x20000 firmware/light/build/matter_light.bin
```

Generate factory partition + QR code (offline, inside the container):
```bash
pip install esp-matter-mfg-tool
./tools/gen_factory.sh                 # writes out/<vid_pid>/<uuid>/*-qrcode.png + *-partition.bin
```
Then flash the factory partition to the `fctry` slot at `0x3E0000`.

## Repository layout

```
firmware/light/          On/Off light — the reference device
  main/app_main.cpp       plain esp-matter code; LED on GPIO 2 (WROOM-32)
  partitions.csv          OTA A/B slots + separate fctry partition (fits 4 MB)
  sdkconfig.defaults      factory-data provider + custom partition table
tools/
  dev.sh                  opens the Docker dev environment
  gen_factory.sh          local QR + factory partition generator
.github/workflows/build.yml  CI: builds in espressif/esp-matter image, attaches .bin to Releases on v* tags
docs/getting-started.md   step-by-step first-device guide
SECURITY.md               flash encryption / secure boot / signed OTA guidance
```

## Conventions

- Certificates: use Matter **test** certs + test VID (0xFFF1–0xFFF4) for hobby
  use. A real certified product needs a CSA-issued Vendor ID.
- Adding a new device type: copy `firmware/light/` to e.g. `firmware/switch/` and
  swap the endpoint type in `app_main.cpp` (esp-matter offers `on_off_switch`,
  `dimmable_light`, `temperature_sensor`, `contact_sensor`, etc.).
- Releases: push a `v*` tag; CI builds and publishes the `.bin`.
- For reproducible builds, consider pinning the image tag (e.g.
  `espressif/esp-matter:release-v1.5`) in `tools/dev.sh` and `build.yml` instead
  of `latest`.

## Never commit

- `out/`, `*.bin`, `*-qrcode.png`, generated CSVs — per-device secrets.
- `*.pem` / secure-boot signing keys — keep offline and backed up.
(These are already covered by `.gitignore`.)

## Open next steps (discussed, not yet done)

1. Add a second device type (switch or temperature sensor) as a concrete
   duplication example.
2. Implement Matter **OTA** so devices update themselves over the air from a
   GitHub Release `.bin` (start from USB flashing, add signed OTA on top).
3. Optionally pin SDK/image versions for reproducibility.

## Note on hardware/USB

Building happens in Docker; flashing happens on the host with `esptool`. On Linux
you can alternatively pass the device into the container
(`--device=/dev/ttyUSB0`) and use `idf.py flash`, but the host route works on
macOS/Windows/Linux alike.
